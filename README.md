Problems with Microsoft Windows 10 

Just a few thoughts to start with:
* A lack in quality of feedback channels to fix known and common issues
 * For years, questions to Windows Tech Support online had replies not even able to understand the question
 * The public UserVoice channel is disconnected: https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/ 
 * One(?) other public resource: https://microsoft.pissedconsumer.com/review.html
 * New Feedback Hub isn't public

* Forced Windows Updates
  * Can disrupt work and make system inoperable
  * Official updates have had errors and not thoroughly tested
  * Can finally delay up to 30 days for critical and 365 days for non-critical

* Windows User Account Control UAC makes it difficult to install programs and other tasks

* Windows Antimalware and Real Time Protection run CPU high on startup

* Windows SuperFetch Indexing also runs CPU high on startup and is in top 10 running processes in background

* Generally can't resize many windows
* Generally can't copy important information and error codes from system message windows to search for help
* Generally a pain to change registry entries
* Have to use PowerShell for command history and then commands are very verbose
* Can't navigate up from User directory to Users and then to drive root (or from any Library directory to User directory)
* Windows firewall doesn't show requests and difficult to block them individually
* Generally portability is lacking because the installation drivers must be downloaded separately during install
* Generally portability is difficult because of machine fingerprinting for licensing
* Generally no per window size and position settings or easily set like KUBUNTU
* Windows 10 now has automatic repair programs to fix disabling of UAC, Antimalware and others
* General lack of allowing user to customize their OS to their usability
* Massive bloatware of third party commercial Windows Apps has increased installation size to 30GB or more
* Proprietary and bloated tools for interfacing with Windows display for improving accessibility
